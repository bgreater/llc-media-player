I think there's a critical milestone ahead of us in 2013, when NITSA (ph) will be considering a regulatory decision to mandate DSRC radios in the new vehicles that come off the line.  This is an important milestone, and the program has been around under three different ]]></text>

It is something you can put your arms around.  I recall when I went down and gave a speech at the NACE (ph), it's the National Association of County Engineers meeting.  George Webb, who's in the audience here, invited me down.  And ]]></text>

And of course these folks are dealing with some pretty day to day issues, and I don't think they were too interested in hearing about the Connected Vehicle Program until I said in 2013 there will be a regulatory decision.  And 50 people in the room their heads popped up and attention was riveted from that point on.

So let's move on here.  I guess there's a, from (inaudible)'s point of view, we have a strong belief ]]>

So we've invested a lot of ourselves into it, and I've personally worked with most of these people up on the panel for several years.  And I've got a lot of hope and expectations for the program.

So we'll begin with Valerie Briggs.  Valerie works at the US DOT Joint Program office.  She is a team lead in knowledge and policy transfer.  Prior to that she worked at ASHTO (ph).  She was the operations ]]>

So it is a multi-modal program that was developed by seven different modes within the Department with also significant stakeholder involvement from many of you through some public meetings.  We now have over 80 people in the Department working in some way on connected vehicles, so that just tells you what a major focus it is ]]></text>

This just is meant to show you the concept that what we're trying to develop in conjunction with our partners at the state and local government and the vehicle manufacturers is the ability to have interoperable communications among all vehicle types with infrastructure elements, as well as with other vehicles and with devices that are used by passengers.  And so this is the challenge before us.

This means that any vehicle will be able to broadcast information about itself to other vehicles and travellers in the system around them.  So for instance, if technology is built into the vehicle electronics, it is able to broadcast a whole bunch of information.  That's what you see by that lower left is the type of information that you can get off of a vehicle today if you have access to the vehicle electronics.  And ]]></text>

So perhaps in future instead of maintaining dynamic message signs, you'll be able to broadcast messages directly to vehicles in a specific vicinity.  This is the other advantage.

One of the major reasons that US DOT is interested in this technology and set of applications is for safety.  Safety is our number one priority and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has recently done an analysis that shows that connected vehicle technology could potentially address 80 percent of the causes ]]>

That's why it's a research program and we're doing research, but it has huge potential to reduce crashes on our roadways.  What we're focusing on now is the ability to provide driver advisories and warnings of hazardous situations.  So if a car is about to get into a crash - if you're about to run a red light, if there's a queue stopped ahead, 00:08 08 if there's a slippery road surface, things like that, or if there is a vehicle around a curve that you may not see - so what we're focusing on is giving the driver information about hazards.

Our research program is divided into application areas focused on developing applications for safety, mobility and the environment, and then we're also doing underlying research on the enabling technology - things like systems engineering, certification, ]]>

And then the area that I work on is the policy research - how do we make this happen?   How do we address the institutional challenges?

I'm just going to step you through how we are looking at this problem and how we hope that we will go from a research initiative into a deployed state.  So the next few slides 00:09 07 kind of tell our philosophy and our research strategy for getting us from where we are today to a deployed state.

We are focusing on first enabling vehicle to vehicle communications for safety applications.  That's where you get the major safety benefits, and we also recognise the challenges with deploying infrastructure, as I'm sure you all are thinking in your mind, how would infrastructure be deployed.  So we're focusing ]]>

So we're focusing on that core set of applications, on proving the benefits of these applications, developing the driver interfaces that are safe, developing globally harmonised standards with our partners around the world, assessing the security issues so that people can't hack into a vehicle, and then enabling interoperability of devices and preparing for the NITSA ]]></text>

They've said that they will make a decision about whether the research has progressed to a stage that they feel that something should be done to encourage the application of the technology.  So that could be a regulatory decision, or it could be something else.

What is a connected vehicle?  It's (inaudible) information sharing between vehicles in the form of vehicle to vehicle communication or vehicle to infrastructure communication.  It identifies immediate crash threat possibility.  It shares information with signals and transportation operators.  It informs, coordinates and warns of unsafe roadway situations.

There are four functional purpose or functions provided by a connected vehicle.  First it provides active safeties in a "here I am" messages between vehicles.  Every vehicle theoretically would have a transponder sending to the surrounding area the speed, location and direction.

And let's say the headway for this bus is supposed to be 10 minutes and it arrives at 12 minutes later, well it gets priority.  But if it arrives ]]></text>
